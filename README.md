# GSoC-2025--Communication-Analysis-Tool-for-Human-AI-Interaction
GSoC @ HumanAI > ISSR > "Communication Analysis Tool for Human-AI Interaction Driving Simulator Experiments"

## Description of the project:
The project basically focuses on building up of a fully-functional prototype of the AI-driven communication analysis tool, which explores and analyzes the high-fidelity audiovisual data of communication between the individuals involved in driving simulation. It helps to better understand the group dynamics, improvising safety measures, and incorporating (AI and machine learning / natural language processing) in the real-world driving scenarios.
